## Return to school
The 2 tables are based on the complete answers of students who were studying at a distance and responded to the following questions:
Survey question w/ 4 point Likert scale (to a great extent, somewhat, little, not at all). The tables below collate To a great extent & somewhat into 1 category and little & not at all in the other category.

* My mental health would get worse: ___
* My mental health would improve: ___

I think this could be either presented as a piechart (see below) or as a bar plot.

## Compare Students to Non-student peers in MENTAL HEALTH

*NB* - To get the corresponding data table extracted uncomment the code in the .RMD file and re-run.

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dat.compare <- read_csv("~/Desktop/R Codes/leger-students/clean-data/leger_student.csv") %>%

                               age_yrs >= 26 & age_yrs < 36 ~ "25 - 35 years",
                               age_yrs > 35 ~ "Over 35")),
         student = factor(student,

# To get the data for the plot un-comment the below
# if wish to get proportion and numbers for all response categories then remove the filtering by value

## MINI INFO BUBBLE: Who is most distressed among students

Adjusting for location, age, health, study mode and perceived income, female students and individuals with a diagnosis of an anxiety or mood disorders report greatest levels of overall psychological distress.


## Data source and description
The results about return to school are based on `r leger_s_w3w4 %>% nrow` responses from students from across Canada between November/December and Mid March.

The sample was `r round((leger_s_w3w4 %>% filter(sex == "Female") %>% nrow)/leger_s_w3w4 %>% nrow*100, 1)`% female. 

On average they are `r round(mean(leger_s_w3w4$age_yrs), 1)` years old (range `r min(leger_s_w3w4$age_yrs)` -- `r max(leger_s_w3w4$age_yrs)`).

From `r nrow(leger_s_w3w4)` respondents, `r leger_s_w3w4 %>% filter(smode == "In-person only") %>% nrow` attended school in person only, `r leger_s_w3w4 %>% filter(smode == "Hybrid") %>% nrow` were in a hybrid mode (attending in person as well as online), and `r leger_s_w3w4 %>% filter(smode == "Online only") %>% nrow` were learning at a distance only.

### Comparison groups in figures on p. 3:
Students were `r leger_student %>% nrow`, The sample was `r round((leger_student %>% filter(sex == 2) %>% nrow)/leger_student %>% nrow*100, 1)`% female, aged `r round(mean(leger_student$age_yrs), 1)` years on average (range `r min(leger_student$age_yrs)` -- `r max(leger_student$age_yrs)`).

Non-student peers were `r peer_only %>% nrow`, The sample was `r round((peer_only %>% filter(sex == 2) %>% nrow)/peer_only %>% nrow*100, 1)`% female, aged `r round(mean(peer_only$age_yrs), 1)` years on average (range `r min(peer_only$age_yrs)` -- `r max(peer_only$age_yrs)`).
